# HID_toggle
If all unignored devices are not connected (e.g., an external mouse), it toggles an HID device ON (e.g. trackpad).
This software is in development, and there are no releases yet.

# Why shouldn't you use this
1) It's for Debian distros only.
2) Some distros already have this functionality built in.
3) Someone else has done it better.
4) It exists 20% because of a niche problem, and 80% because I thought it was a neat exercise.
